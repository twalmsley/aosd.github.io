                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>There are a couple of significant tasks that I plan to work on this year, one of which is a
                        continuation and expansion of the work I did in the last few months of 2024, while the other is
                        completely new (to me at least) and which I hope will lead to some new and interesting results.
                    </p>
                    <p>These tasks are currently self-funded and will be detailed in future blog posts, although I will
                        be happy work with others on these tasks especially if funding is involved because I have
                        limited funds available and may need to find other work instead.</p>

                    <h1>1. Java Foundation Ontology</h1>
                    <p>Over the last two or three months of 2024 I worked on a <a
                            href="https://github.com/twalmsley/FoundationOntology">Java Foundation Ontology</a>
                        along with a Java Persistence API (JPA) implementation and an in-memory implementation, as well
                        as
                        some example code in unit tests and a small </a
                            href="https://github.com/twalmsley/foundation_spring_demo">Spring Boot project</a> to show
                        how to use it.</p>
                    <p>For 2025 I plan to continue working on this, with the following tasks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More examples and use cases to aid further development and with finding problems with the
                            model</li>
                        <li>Import/export data from IES4 models</li>
                        <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/gchq/MagmaCore">MagmaCore</a> as a persistence layer to add
                            HQDM support</li>
                        <li>Add TypeDB as a persistence layer, hopefully to reduce the impedance match between the graph
                            model and JPA</li>
                        <li>Re-implement a project that was developed using MagmaCore directly. This will be a good test
                            for whether the Java Foundation Ontology is easier to work with than MagmaCore.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>2. Complex Types for Functional Data Modelling</h1>
                    <p>This will involve the use of statically typed programming languages try to capture the meaning
                        within data structures so that other objects with the same meaning can be used in their place if
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>It's hard to give examples of what I mean by this so I will produce a more detailed blog post to
                        clarify things once some useful progress has been made.</p>
                    <p>My hope is that it will lead to some of the following benefits and applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IDEs with built-in type checking will be able to find modelling errors more easily.</li>
                        <li>The focus will be on functions (activities) as well as the data they consume and produce.
                        </li>
                        <li>Functions will represent real-world activities and processes as well as their resources and
                            environmental requirements, so it will not be possible to carry out an activity without all
                            of the prerequisites.</li>
                        <li>Functions will model 'everything' required by the activity, and the results will include
                            waste items produced by the activity that must be dealt with somehow as well as the desired
                            results of the activity.</li>
                        <li>Complex data types will capture more information about what prerequisites are needed by
                            functions.</li>
                        <li>Stronger types will allow inferencing engines to search for possible combinations of
                            functions that will solve a particular problem, or that will lead to new and unexpected
                            results that might be useful.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I anticipate that the data types needed will be complex and possibly deeply nested in order to
                        capture the required details, and that the corresponding function signatures will make it almost
                        impossible to call them with the wrong data. This is to be proven of course, but that is the
                        goal of this task.</p>
